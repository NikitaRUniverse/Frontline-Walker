## Setup

Throughout the project, you will be required to write progress reports. These reports will be published on the [Capstone project website](https://capstone.innopolis.university/). To contribute to the website, you will need to follow these steps:

1. One of the team member (e.g. `john5000`) should fork this repository under the name of the team (e.g. `dream-team`). This will create a copy of the repository under the name `john5000/dream-team`.

2. Install latest version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) on your local machine. Also, make sure you have a code editor installed. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, but you may use the one you prefer.

3. Clone the forked repository **with submodules** to your local machine using

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/john5000/dream-team
```

## Run the website locally

To start the website localy, run

```bash
hugo server --minify --theme=hugo-book
```

The last line in the terminal output should look like

```bash
Web Server is available at http://localhost:port/ (by default: http://localhost:1313/)
```

Visit `http://localhost:port` in your browser to access your local instance of the website. Now all of you changes in the website's source code should be propagated automatically.

## Contribution rules

We set up a few rules to make the contribution process as smooth as possible:

1. When you firstly clone the repository, you should create a folder with your group name (same as the name of the forked repository e.g. `dream-team`) in both `content/docs/$YEAR/` and `static/$YEAR/` (e.g. `content/docs/2024/dream-team` and `static/2024/dream-team`). This is where you will store your progress reports and static content respectively. Note, that if you modify any other files, **you will not pass the CI/CD pipeline** and your changes will not be merged.

2. For each progress report you will have to create respective markdown file (e.g. `content/docs/2024/dream-team/week1.md`).
3. You should create `_index.md` file in your group folder (e.g. `content/docs/2024/dream-team/_index.md`) with the following content:

```md
---
bookCollapseSection: true
title: "Dream Team"
---
```

## Git essentials (for beginners)

After you feel you have made enough changes, run

```bash
git add .
```

to [stage all changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add), then

```bash
git commit -m "Your very informative progress report that describes the changes you've made"
```

to [commit your changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) to the local repository. Finally, run

```bash
git push
```

to [push your changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) to the remote repository or

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name
```

if you are pushing for the first time.

## Pull requests

Now that you have made your changes, you will need to properly submit them so that no merge conflicts happen.

**Instructions to merge your branch with the master branch**

- Open your github repo (e.g. <https://github.com/john5000/dream-team>)
- Click on `Contribute` button
- Click on `Open pull request`
- Make sure that the base repository is `IU-PR/Capstone_project` and the base branch is `master`
- Make sure that the head repository is your repository name (e.g. `john5000/dream-team`) and the head branch is `your-branch-name`
- Name your pull request in a format `My_Cool_Project_Group_Name (Week X): Very short description`
- Once done, press `Create pull request`
- Make sure that the CI/CD pipeline has passed. If not, fix the errors and push the changes again to your branch (you don't need to create a new pull request, just push the changes to your branch)
- You can preview your changes by clicking on `Deploy preview` link provided by netlify bot in the pull request comments
- Done! Admins will review your work and merge your changes into the main repo soon

## Shortcodes

This blog template uses a handful of shortcodes. Shortcode *(in a nutshell)* is "mark" inside your markdown code that enables certain features within its code block. For example, you can define a codeblock of LaTeX code that renders LaTeX formulas. You can also define a codeblock that describes a structure of a graph. Below are example of these two.

### LaTeX

How to write in LaTeX:

```md
{{<katex>}}
your latex formula
{{</katex>}}
```

This produces an inline formula. If you want to center your formula, use `display` property like so:

```md
{{<katex display>}}
your centered latex formula
{{</katex>}}
```

[Latex cheatsheet](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet.pdf)

### Mermaid (graphs)

How to create graphs:

1. [Take a look at Mermaid syntax](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/)
2. Pick a graph you want to use
3. Write necessary code

**Ex:**

```md
{{<mermaid>}}
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch develop
  commit
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  commit
  commit
{{</mermaid>}}
```

will be rendered as

```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch develop
  commit
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  commit
  commit
```

Refer to [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) for examples.

### PDF embedding

To embed a PDF file, use the following shortcode:

```md
{{< embed-pdf url="/2024/dream-team/some-file.pdf" >}}
```

### Other shortcodes

This project's shortcodes and their descriptions can be found in `layouts/shortcodes`. They all use the same syntax:

```
{{<shortcode>}}
...stuff/..
{{</shortcode>}}
```

Try them out if you think they are useful in your progress reports.
